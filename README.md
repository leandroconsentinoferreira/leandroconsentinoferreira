👋 Hi, I’m @leandroconsentinoferreira
👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems 🤖, IoT 📱, Electronics 💻, and Product Development 📈.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about Microcontrollers (ESP32, PIC, AVR) and Wireless Communication Protocols 📡.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving PCB Design (KiCAD, Altium) 📈, C/C++ Programming for embedded systems, and Automation using Python 🐍.
📫 How to reach me: E-mail or LinkedIn.
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy teaching and have experience as a professor of advanced programming and microcontrollers 📚.
